							<h4 id="about">About Julio Georgiou</h4>
							<p>Julio has been involved in the fitness industry for the past twelve years. He's passion for the industry started at the age of sixteen.</p>
							<p>Julio's background of training comes through a variety of sports. Therefore giving Julio a wide and effective way of training his clients, which makes his workouts more exciting and fun. Using such a variety of training methods helps his clients achieve optimum results.</p>
							<p>Since the beginning, he has helped hundreds of people get the body and lifestyle they want. He will take anybody on to train (the more challenging the better). If you are in need of a big push to get you started, then having him as your trainer is ideal for setting you up and sending you off in the right direction towards your goals.</p>

							<h4 id="pt">Personal Training</h4>
							<p>As a personal trainer, I tailor my sessions to your needs in order for you to achieve maximum results. Typically, if you're looking to lose weight then the emphasis will be cardio vascular work. Those wishing to tone will find more resistance exercises in the sessions. Alternatively, people wanting all round fitness can expect a combination of both.</p>
							<p>I train majority of my clients in a newly open gym located in north London. The gym has a friendly environment with determined members and welcoming staff. The gym uses state of the art Nautilus equipment and by using such equipment helps with getting you closer to your fitness goals. My training can also be done at home or as group sessions, which can be more fun for certain individuals.</p>
							<p>I believe that most people fail at fitness due to the following:</p>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Not putting enough effort into sessions or not training regularly</li>
									<li>Lack of focus and clearly defined goals</li>
									<li>Lack of fitness training knowledge and techniques, which lead to boredom</li>
									<li>Not pushing yourself out of the comfort zone due to lack of confidence</li>
									<li>Not enjoying exercising in general</li>
									<li>Assuming there is no time for training (when there is somehow time for activities leading to an unhealthy livestyle i.e. Television)</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="clear"></div>
						<div id="content-left-text" class="main-text-style">
							<p>The main one is doing the same training over and over again and expecting different results. A quote I normally use is "If you do what you have always done you get what you have always got". Remember that the level of thinking that has got you to where you are now is not the level of thinking that is going to get you to where you want to be. If any of this rings a bell, using me as your personal trainer will show you how fitness can work for you and how you can get what you want.</p>
							<p>My vast knowledge of techniques and countless exercises will ensure that no two sessions are the same, keeping them fresh and exciting. I will guide you and show you that there is nothing to be afraid of and you will quickly realise that those goals you set yourself can be achieved.</p>
							<p>Diet advice is also given to you during the session to suit you and your lifestyle. Sorting out your diet is a very important part of improving your fitness and losing bodyfat/weight. A lot of you who are reading this have probably tried loads of different diets, maybe a few different slimming clubs only to find that the weight has dropped initially and then come back on again. A lot of diets are time consuming because you need to count the points or measure portion sizes, I intend to show you simple rules you should follow in order to loose the weight quickly and effectively.</p>
							<p>My personal training session always finishes with a full body stretch, a fantastic way to unwind and relax after a session. The fitness session typically lasts an hour, and takes place at <a href="http://www.paramounthealthandfitness.co.uk/" target="_blank" style="color:#0a4972;">Paramount health &#38; fitness</a>, located in north London. Also home visits can be arranged for those who live in North London.</p>

								<span class="icon-bubbles-4" style="font-size:50px;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:16px;">
								&#8220;I have been training with Julio since July 2009. I am 47 and had given up cigarettes and put on a bit of weight and decided that I wanted to get fit. I had not been to a gym in years but walked everywhere. My weight had been constant for 30 years so my aim really was just to get back to my normal weight and have more stamina.
								<br/><br/>
								Julio was also my son's tennis coach. I knew I could work with him because he doesn't take a boot camp approach. He listens to your own goals and helps get you there. I very quickly lost the few lbs weight bur started to get into the gym and working out. My next goal was to fit into a pair of jeans that hadn't fitted me in years and that was achieved quite easily. I started running a bit and decide to have a 5km run as my goal. I am running 10km on Saturday and with Julio's help plan to train for the half marathon. I never in a million years thought I would not only be doing this but loving it. I am far too bossy to have someone shout at me to make me work which is what I had thought personal trainers would be. It is really good to have a training plan and a goal as it encourages me to go to the gym a lot on my own. Having a personal trainer makes all the difference as the training is tailored your age, weight, level of fitness and goals. Over the last 18 months I have worked on muscular strength, cardiovascular endurance, and flexibility, power, skill, and speed. I have exercised muscles I didn't know existed. Julio knows exactly when to push me hard and when I'm stressed what work outs make me feel better, boxing is a good one!&#8221;

								&#8220;My husband and i had both worked hard to get into shape and lose weight. We decided we needed to step up a level with our exercise to help keep us motivated. So we decided to try a personal training session, initially we weren't very keen due to our pre&#45;conceived ideas about personal trainers (macho, vain, bossy...sorry&#33;), but after our first individual sessions with Julio we were hooked&#33;
								<br/><br/>
								Julio has a unique style of personal training, which caters to your individual needs; he is keen to understand your goals and works with you to achieve them. Julio has transformed both my husbands and my body shape and fitness levels.
								<br/><br/>
								Main attributes Julio brings to our fitness sessions include:
								<ul>
									<li>Well planned sessions, no two sessions are the same.</li>
									<li>lots of variety in the exercises and equipment used.</li>
									<li>A different approach to working out.</li>
									<li>Julio pays attention to your technique and coaches you through the session to avoid you feeling uncomfortable and reducing injuries.</li>
									<li>We are always working towards achieving our specific goals.</li>
									<li>Julio has a real interest in your progress and success.</li>
									<li>Julio monitors progress via fitness tests, before after photos/measurements - all very motivating!</li>
									<li>Reviews your diet and provides advice as appropriate.</li>
								</ul>
							</p><p>
								Julio is very good at building your confidence in the sessions so you are achieving more than you think your body and mind are capable of. We definitely recommend having Julio as a fitness trainer.&#8221;
