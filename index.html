						<p>Time and time again I come across people who meet me and the first thing they say when they find out I am a dentist is...."I hate going to the dentist!" then add as an after thought, "it's nothing personal!"<br/></p>
						<p>Dentistry has been around since atleast 7000 BC and yet in the 21st Centuary people still hate going.<br/></p>
						<p>I have been a practicing dentist for over 10 years. My passion is to introduce you to the concept of COMFORT dentistry, a world where  having dental treatment is  something to look forward to, I dare say, even to escape to! The age of hating or being anxious is gone as we enter this era of Soothing, Relaxing, Comfort dentistry.<br/>Dr Busola Olubajo</p>
